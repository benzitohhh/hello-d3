	  "title": "Baffle i.e. dashboard, vibration reducing apparatus for use in loudspeaker system in vehicle, has transducer reacting to input signal by causing diaphragm to move in direction to reduce vibration imparted to baffle",
	  "patentAbstract": "The apparatus has a baffle (11) i.e. dashboard, subjected to vibration. An electro-acoustic transducer (12) i.e. loudspeaker driver, is seated in the baffle. Another electro-acoustic transducer (13) reacts to an input signal i.e. stereo signal, applied to the transducer (13) by causing a diaphragm (22) to move in a direction, where the movement of the diaphragm reduces vibration imparted to the baffle from the movement of another diaphragm (21) while maintaining an acoustic output when the direction is opposite to another direction.\n\nAn INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a loudspeaker system comprising an enclosure.\n\nApparatus for reducing baffle i.e. dashboard, vibration in a loudspeaker system (all claimed) in a vehicle. Can also be used for a rear shelf, door panel, structural panel, wall, ceiling and floor in a room, residence, business, theater, stadium and concert hall, rear package shelf, seatback, floorboard, interior door panel and a headliner.\n\nThe diaphragm of the transducer is moved in opposite direction to the diaphragm of the other transducer, thus reducing resultant force applied to rigid members, and hence reducing undesired resultant vibrations in the baffle and improving performance of a loudspeaker system.",

	  "patentAbstract": "The assembly has an acoustic driver mounted in a teardrop shaped acoustic waveguide such that a surface of the driver radiates sound waves into the waveguide. An acoustic volume (22) is acoustically coupled to the acoustic waveguide for increasing an amplitude of the sound waves radiated from the acoustic waveguide. Electronic components are positioned in the acoustic volume. The waveguide has multiple curved sections (31A, 31B) substantially defining the acoustic volume. A baffle structure causes a length of an acoustic path within a range of lengths.\n\n\nLoudspeaker assembly.\n\nThe assembly eliminates the dip in the combined output of the acoustic driver and the waveguide at frequencies without adversely affecting the operation of the waveguide system, thus improving the operation performance of the assembly.",

	  "patentAbstract": "The system has a force bias eliminator and an electromagnetic actuator connected to an energy source, and a load-unload detector for detecting loading or unloading of a plant e.g. seat. A control system is operably coupled to the load-unload detector, the force bias eliminator and the actuator. The control system controls the actuator to preserve energy available from the energy source while the force bias eliminator responds to counteract the forces. The load-unload detector comprises a pressure switch that is located on a surface of the plant.\n\nINDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:\n(1) a method for controlling an active suspension system\n(2) a vehicle seat system comprising a force bias eliminator.\n\nActive suspension system. Uses include but are not limited to a seat of a passenger car, a floor of a cargo truck, weapons platform of a military vehicle, boat, ship and an aircraft.\n\nThe system enables the force bias eliminator to respond quickly while controlling the fast-responding of the actuator so as to preserve the available energy for operating the actuator. The system directly measures the energy stored in the energy source, and the controller can predict the level and discharge rate of available electrical energy, so that force bias eliminator ensures fast response time. The controller can immediately respond to the force bias eliminator to counteract the load-unload event and actively manage the power drawn by the actuator so as to manage the energy source rapidly. The load-unload detector can detect the occurrence of loading/unloading quickly.",

Reduces the number of unique components that must be stocked in a factory that makes more than one model of vehicle, and provides aftermarket systems that are pre-tuned by their manufacturer to provide optimal signal processing for the stock electro-acoustic transducers in each of potential vehicle models. Amplifier is used for diagnostics, such as to determine whether and identify which of the electro-acoustic transducers or electro-acoustic transducer housings are damaged or determine whether the proper electro-acoustic transducers have been installed in a particular model of vehicle to reduce manufacturing errors and related costs.",
